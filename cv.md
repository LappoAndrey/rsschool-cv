## Objective

JavaScript/Front-end, Python Developer

## Summary

I have fifteen years of experience in software development. Vast experience in working with SQLite, Postgre databases, etc. developed and implemented a variety of reports.

Additionally I was interviewing and onboarding new colleagues, helping them to understand our product, managing they activities.

Apart from that Iâ€™ve been studying Python on my own for a year and graduated from web development courses in June. At the moment I continue to study Python, Django, Flask, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS . The skills I gained were applied in the development of a website for the pharmaceutical market.

My current firm is too small to grow up. I want more interesting projects, new knowledges and new experience.
